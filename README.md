Python utility to help solve the board game Clue

All it really does is perform all the deductions of who-has-what based on the information made available to everyone during gameplay. That information being: who made a suggestion during a turn and who (if anyone) showed them a card in response.

Think of this utility as applying the principles of card counting to playing a kid's board game. Enjoy!
