# TODOs 

+ rename all '*_num' variables as '*_id', since that is more accurate 
+ Introduce a 'verbosity' flag to the method offer_turn_intel() to indicate whether to log totally processed turns 
+ Maybe don't display turn info unless the user enters a special code, similar to how "Update" functions
+ Disable ANSI escape codes on terminals that don't support them
